    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole wheat flour.</li>
        <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>⅓ cup wheat germ.</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder.</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda.</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar.</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>8 ⅓ tablespoons unsalted butter.</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups buttermilk.</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1:</li>
        <p>In a food processor or in a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, white flour, wheat germ or oats, baking powder, baking soda, brown sugar, and salt.</p>
        <li>Step 2:</li>
        <p>Cut the butter into small pieces with a knife, and add the butter to the flour-mixture. Mix until the mixture has a sand-like consistency.</p>
        <li>Step 3:</li>
        <p>Make a well in the center of the flour-butter mixture, and add the buttermilk and eggs. Stir until the liquids are fully incorporated.</p>
        <li>Step 4:</li>
        <p>Heat a frying pan over medium heat and grease the surface with 1 tablespoon of butter or oil. Ladle the batter onto the surface to form 4 inch pancakes. Once bubbles form on the top of the pancakes, flip them over, and cook them on the other side for about 2 minutes.</p>
